## Mt Pluto & Amethyst Egg


### Suitecase 's Mountain Story

_One day Suitecase went to climb a mountain called mt. Pluto._

_Suitecase had a very old map which showed an_

_Amethyst egg hidden somewhere in the middle of the mountain._

_While he was climbing  he saw  a California condor flying._

_It was carrying some shiny thing_

_Suitecase opened the hang glider and started to follow the condor._

_Then he was able to capture the condor_

_it stopped moving. There was a giant rocket pushing the condor._

_He was surprised to see it was not a real condor._

_He called it a condorbot_

_There was a door in the condorbot_
