## Mt Pluto & Amethyst Egg


### Suitecase 's Mountain Story

_One day Suitecase went to climb a mountain called mt. Pluto._

_Suitecase had a very old map which showed an_

_Amethyst egg hidden somewhere in the middle of the mountain._

_While he was climbing  he saw  a California condor flying._

_It was carrying some shiny thing_

_Suitecase opened the hang glider and started to follow the condor._

_Then he was able to capture the condor_

_it stopped moving. There was a giant rocket pushing the condor._

_He was surprised to see it was not a real condor._

_He called it a condorbot_

_There was a door in the condorbot_

_He opened the door. There was a key._

_He took it and put it in his pocket. He did not know what it is for._

_He tied up the condorbot to his hang glide._

_Started to glide up and landed on the top of the mountain._

_He followed a trail that led to a secret passage._

_At the end of the secret passage he found a box._ 

_He used the key that found in the condorbot to open box._

_There was another key inside box._

_This did not what this is for._

_There was a secret compartment._

_He tried this key to open the compartment._

_To his surprise it opened._

_He found the Amethyst egg in there._

_He took it, and looked very nice and shiny._

_He opened the egg. There was a glowing crystal._

_Also there was a note. It said you have found the Amethyst egg._

**_Congratulations!!!!_**

_He was successful in finding what he started to look for._

_Now he took the egg and the condorbot attached to the hang glide._

_Started gliding down the mountain top and came down._

_He showed it  to me ramacsv._

_I was very happy to see it and liked it very much._
